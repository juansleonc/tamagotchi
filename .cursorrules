# Cursor Rules for this Project

## Automatic Context7 Usage

Always use Context7 when you need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools (`resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs`) without having to explicitly ask for it.

### When to use Context7:
- When generating code that uses external libraries
- When needing up-to-date documentation for APIs or frameworks
- When configuring new dependencies or tools
- When searching for implementation examples for specific functionalities

### Known Library Syntax:
You can use library ID syntax directly in requests:
- `/rails/rails` for Ruby on Rails
- `/websites/reactnative_dev` for React Native
- `/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby` for GraphQL Ruby
- `/rspec/rspec-rails` for RSpec

This allows skipping the ID resolution step and getting documentation directly.

## AI Agents Usage

This project includes AI agents for development assistance. Use them when:

- **Testing Agent**: When you need to generate tests or analyze test coverage
- **Code Review Agent**: Before committing code, review for style and security
- **Best Practices Agent**: Check code against framework best practices
- **Clean Code Agent**: Detect code smells and get refactoring suggestions
- **Documentation Agent**: Generate or update documentation
- **Security Agent**: Scan for security vulnerabilities

## Project Standards

### Code Style
- Ruby: Follow RuboCop rules, use trailing commas in multiline calls, use `%r{}` for regex
- JavaScript/TypeScript: Use ESLint and Prettier, consistent quote style
- GraphQL: PascalCase for types, camelCase for fields, add descriptions

### Testing
- Rails: Write RSpec tests for models, controllers, and GraphQL resolvers
- React Native: Write Jest tests for components and hooks
- Aim for good test coverage but prioritize quality

### Documentation
- All GraphQL types and fields must have descriptions
- Complex logic should have inline comments
- Update README and guides when adding features

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails with GraphQL
- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: RSpec (Rails), Jest (React Native)
- **Code Quality**: RuboCop, ESLint, Prettier
